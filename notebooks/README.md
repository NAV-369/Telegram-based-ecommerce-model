# Task 4: Model Comparison & Selection

## Objective

Compare different models and select the best-performing one for the ## entity extraction task.

## Steps

## 1. Fine-Tune Multiple Models
	•	Fine-tune the following models to compare their performance:
	•	XLM-Roberta: A large multilingual model designed for NER tasks.
	•	DistilBERT: A smaller, lighter model for efficient NER tasks with reduced resource consumption.
	•	mBERT (Multilingual BERT): A multilingual version of BERT, suitable for languages like ## Amharic.
	•	Other models (e.g., ## afroxmlr, ## bert-tiny-amharic, or ## custom pre-trained models).

## 2. Evaluate Each Fine-Tuned Model
	•	Use the ## validation set to evaluate the performance of each fine-tuned model.
	•	Calculate key evaluation metrics, such as:
	•	Precision
	•	Recall
	•	F1-score

results = trainer.evaluate()  
print(results)  

## 3. Compare Models
	•	Compare the models based on the following criteria:
	•	Accuracy: How well the model predicts the correct entities.
	•	Speed: The time taken for inference on new data.
	•	Robustness: The model’s ability to handle ## multi-modal data or variations in input text.

## 4. Select the Best-Performing Model
	•	Use the evaluation metrics to identify the ## best-performing model for ## production.
	•	Consider trade-offs between performance and efficiency (e.g., if a lightweight model provides acceptable accuracy, prioritize it for resource-constrained environments).

## Outcome

By completing this task, you will have identified the ## best-performing NER model for extracting entities such as ## products, ## prices, and ## locations from ## Amharic Telegram messages.
